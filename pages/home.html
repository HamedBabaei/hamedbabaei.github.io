            project in collaboration with <a href="https://orkg.org/">Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG)</a> project
            at TIB, with aim of employing ML and NLP techniques to scholarly text. <br>
            I earned my bachelor’s degree in computer science and my master’s degree in Soft Computing and AI.
            I worked as an NLP Researcher for different companies for almost three years befor joining TIB.
            I have experience in both academics and industry. Back in the time that I wasn't in TIB, in different
            companies, I have done research, analysis, designing, and implementation of various models in the field.
            In academia, I kept my research on different topics, ranging from Social Media tasks to Language Models
            and Knowledge Graphs. I have worked in a team of data scientists as a team leader, NLP specialist, and researcher.</p>
        <br>
        <p> My research interests comprise the topics in area of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing,
            Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models, Ontology Learning, and Question Answering. </p>
