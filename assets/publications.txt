Consequently, words and meanings play an essential role in specifying sarcasm. Enriched feature extraction techniques were proposed to capture both words and meanings in the contexts. Due to the overlapping features in sarcastic and non-sarcastic texts, a CNN model extracts local features from the combined class-dependent statistical embedding of sarcastic texts with contextualized embedding. Another component BiLSTM extracts long dependencies from combined non-sarcastic statistical and contextualized embeddings. This work combines a classifier that uses the combined high-level features of CNN and BiLSTM for sarcasm detection to produce the final predictions. The experimental analysis presented in this paper shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In this paper, we present the first Persian single-relation question answering dataset and a model that uses a knowledge graph as a source of knowledge to answer questions. We create the ParsSimpleQA dataset semi-automatically in two steps. First, we build single-relation question templates. Next, we automatically create simple questions and answers using templates, entities, and relations from Farsbase. To present the reliability of the presented dataset, we proposed a simple question-answering system that receives questions and uses deep learning and information retrieval techniques for answering questions. The experimental results presented in this paper show that the ParsSimpleQA dataset is very promising for the Persian simple question-answering task.",

abstract = {To practice the evidence-based medicine, clinicians are interested to find the most suitable research for the clinical decision making. The use of knowledge graphs (KGs) in evidence-based clinical decision support systems is becoming increasingly popular. However, existing KG construction frameworks are not fully automated and contextualized, thus unable to adapt to new domains and incorporate constantly changing information into their knowledge base, resulting in loss of relevance over time. Furthermore, existing KGs construction frameworks don't generate KG that provide relevant information within an acceptable response time for evidence-based practitioners because the organization of constructed subgraphs is neither topic-specific nor evidence-based PICO (Participants/Problem P, Intervention-I, Comparison C, Outcome O) query-friendly. By employing concept extraction, semantic enrichment, optimized clustering, and state of art Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with BioBERT based encoded representation to categorize PICO elements and predict relationships between concepts using huge corpus of publicly available literature on COVID-19 and cerebral aneurysm, this paper proposes a topic specific, PICO enabled, and fully automated framework to curate information and create KG of different clinical domains. The evaluation shows that the proposed framework achieves significant improvement over baseline models and has 93 %, and 82 % accuracy on aneurysm and COVID data set respectively for PICO classification. Also, the relationship extraction module has an accuracy of 96 % with precision and recall being 92 %, and 90 % respectively.}

abstract="We propose the LLMs4OL approach, which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for Ontology Learning (OL). LLMs have shown significant advancements in natural language processing, demonstrating their ability to capture complex language patterns in different knowledge domains. Our LLMs4OL paradigm investigates the following hypothesis: Can LLMs effectively apply their language pattern capturing capability to OL, which involves automatically extracting and structuring knowledge from natural language text? To test this hypothesis, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation using the zero-shot prompting method. We evaluate nine different LLM model families for three main OL tasks: term typing, taxonomy discovery, and extraction of non-taxonomic relations. Additionally, the evaluations encompass diverse genres of ontological knowledge, including lexicosemantic knowledge in WordNet, geographical knowledge in GeoNames, and medical knowledge in UMLS.",
